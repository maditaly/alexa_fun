Building Alexa Skills with 3rd &amp; 4th graders

I built a Skill Named = Quiz Template
I set the invocation name = Bourbon glass (It was late and I was disappointed that my other one didn't work)

I checked and they look linked correctly.


TEST results:
alexa ask bourbon glass if I should have a glass => Null response, "There was a problem with the requested skill's response"
alexa ask bourbon glass if I should have a glass = > no response
